# xrdtools

An R package of a small collection of import functions
for X-ray diffraction data (all very simple, some quite old).

These are the same import functions as in the
[xray-diffractometry](https://github.com/solarchemist/xray-diffractometry) repo,
except now packaged as an R package.
That sister repo contains other (old) functions for peak fitting and producing
LaTeX tables, which are not part of this R package, as well as more notes
and background.
